# Social Battery Forecast

This project aims to forecast an individual's social battery levels using machine learning techniques. Social battery refers to the amount of energy one has for social interactions, and this project helps predict when levels might be low or high based on various factors.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model training for time series forecasting
- Prediction and visualization of social battery levels
- Evaluation of forecast accuracy

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/`: Raw data files
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis
- `src/`: Source code modules
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models
- `tests/`: Unit tests
