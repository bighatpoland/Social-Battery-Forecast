Social Battery Forecast 🔋💀
An absurdly dramatic predictor for when introverts will finally snap.
"You'll hate everyone by 19:42. Suggested action: fake a phone call and Irish goodbye."
Perfect for people who treat social interaction like a slowly draining phone battery... except the charger is solitude and Netflix.
🚨 What It Does
This magnificent piece of software analyzes:

Your calendar (how many meetings did you foolishly agree to?)
Estimated number of humans you'll encounter
Eye contact intensity (on a scale from "polite nod" to "soul-piercing small talk")

Then delivers brutally honest forecasts such as:

"Social battery critical at 15:17. Evacuate immediately."
"You'll be 100% done with humanity by 20:05. Blanket fort recommended."
"Peak misanthropy expected at 18:30. Do not operate heavy machinery or speak to coworkers."

🛠️ Tech Stack (Because Someone Will Ask)

Python (the language of introverts who prefer talking to computers)
Pure, unadulterated nonsense
A dash of fake math for legitimacy
Zero actual science
